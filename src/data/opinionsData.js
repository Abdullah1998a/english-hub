          "I have divided my opinion into two different directions: I support women working if they don't have responsibilities like children or if they are the only ones who can financially support their families, whether they are married or single. I consider this an exception. On the other hand, if a woman has children and a husband to take care of, I believe she should stay at home due to her vital role in raising her children and teaching them good morals.",

          "I think it's a deeply personal decision that depends on various factors such as individual preferences, family needs, economic circumstances, and cultural expectations. As a working woman, I absolutely agree with women working, especially considering the difficult economic circumstances in Jordan. Incomes are necessary to maintain a desired standard of living or even to cover essential expenses.",

          "I think this matter depends on the woman herself and whether she can balance both roles. I am not against a woman working, but she must know that it is not an easy path and she must prioritize her responsibilities. This is more important than the home because, naturally, one of a woman's basic tasks is to manage the household and care for her children, which is a very noble role. However, some toxic ideas from Western society have led some women to feel that their freedom is restricted, which is not true. Some men also view women solely as housewives and treat financial support as an act of compassion, which is one of the main reasons women seek financial independence.",

          "In my opinion, whether a woman is married with children or not, she is entitled to work because, like men, she has studied and worked hard. Therefore, she should not have to sacrifice staying at home to raise children or manage the household. While a working woman might have a negative effect on her children, she is not forced to stay home, especially in the present time when things have changed. It is better for a woman to be independent. Work is very important for women, morally and not just financially. More important than this is the husband's support, as the basis of a marital relationship is participation in everything, including raising children.",

          "I believe this matter requires mutual agreement, so no one has the right to have a unilateral opinion. The couple can handle it together, and the daughter can handle it with her father. I mentioned the father because, most of the time, it’s the father who opposes, not the mother. This mainly happens in our Arab countries due to our customs and traditions, so it requires mutual agreement. If I’m going to discuss this matter with my future wife, I’ll tell her that I don’t mind if she wants to work, but with conditions. She must be able to manage the home so that one doesn’t overwhelm the other. The house should not affect her work, and her work should not affect the house. However, I acknowledge that things might be different if we have children in the future.",

They enable students to identify problems and find solutions, and they make explaining ideas easier than traditional methods.",

          "Since I studied in both periods and experienced both methods, I suffered a lot during my school days because there was no Internet available for learning. Going to a center for a broader explanation of the subject was expensive and exhausting. The greatest reliance was on teachers, and if a student did not understand the teacher’s explanation, they would fail the subject because any other source was almost impossible to access. Nowadays, as a student and a teacher, I strongly favor modern education methods because they are diverse and suit different levels of students, from the academically weak to the distinguished ones.",

          "I think this is a really controversial topic. In my view, both traditional and modern methods have indispensable advantages and some harmful disadvantages. One of the most important advantages of traditional methods is that they promote effective interaction with your teacher or lecturer and ensure high commitment. Modern methods provide many sources that strengthen your knowledge in your field. However, a serious flaw in modern methods is that studying on a phone can increase distractions through social media and so on. Ultimately, I believe traditional methods are better for me.",

          "I think that depends on the country's prosperity itself. Maybe the older generation struggled to get proper education and basic amenities like water, electricity, and the internet. But in general, their life was easier and simpler. They could raise a family without high costs and work fewer hours with great wages because of the good economy. The current generation in our country is really struggling in many aspects of life. They literally live harsh lives. For instance, they cannot get married easily because it costs a massive amount of money, and they have to work long hours with incredibly low pay just to live a modest life. Ultimately, a country's prosperity plays a vital role in determining whether people's lives are harsh or comfortable.",

          "In my opinion, the current generation is suffering more than the older generation. In the current generation, there are fewer jobs, and proving yourself requires great effort, experience, and obtaining many courses. You must always be aware of what is modern. With the current global conditions, many people have to work more than one job. In the past, jobs were more available, and you could work with any qualification. However, the older generation also faced challenges, such as the lack of modern equipment that we have today.",

          "Of course, both generations face challenges, and it's difficult to say definitively that one has it more luxurious than the other because it depends on many factors, such as whether you live in a developing country, which is undoubtedly more challenging than living in a developed country. It also depends on parents' financial situation and their ability to provide a good education. These conditions can affect both generations. But in my opinion, the current generation is suffering more. One disadvantage is the pervasive influence of technology and social media. For example, if we compare the current generation with the older generation regarding reading habits, we see a significant difference. Statistics indicate that most of the current generation suffers from overthinking and, to a lesser extent, ADHD (in children), due to excessive phone and technology use, which can damage mental health. However, the older generation also faced significant challenges, such as wars and a lack of technology. While the absence of technology had its drawbacks, it also had some benefits.",

Second, I surround myself with positivity. The people I surround myself with should have a big impact on my motivation, so I make sure that I'm surrounded by positive people who support my goals.",

Additionally, for men with chronically ill or barren wives, it can prevent them from engaging in Haram relationships. I highly support having an extended family, but only on the condition that the man is fair between wives and is both financially and physically capable.",

The man has to divide his love equally between two women, not just love but also things like money and sweet words. Justice between them is not easy, and it’s challenging for some women to accept polygamy. So, while it’s not forbidden, it is not easy either.",
