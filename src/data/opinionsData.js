          "I divided my opinion into two different directions; I support to go work If a woman doesn't have any responsibilities like kids or she was the only one who can finantiate her family whether if she was married or single, I consider this state as an exceptation. In the other hand, like a woman has kids and a husband that she have to take care of. In this case, I agree that she must stay at home because of her vital role of raising her kids and teaching them good morals.",

          "I think it's deeply personal decision and it depends on a variety of factors such as individual preferences, family needs economic circumstances and cultural expectations for me as a worker woman. I absolutely agree with going work, especially that we are in Jordan facing difficult economic circumstances. So incomes are necessary to maintain a desired standard of living or even to cover essential expenses.",

          "I think that this matter depends on the woman herself, whether she is able to do such a thing with each other or not. In my opinion, I am not against a woman working, but on the condition that she must know that she has chosen a path that is not easy and that she must put her priority first and foremost. This is more important than the home, because God naturally created for women that one of her basic tasks is to work the house and take care of her children, and by the way, this is a very great thing, but because of some toxic ideas that came to us from Western society, the girl began to feel that her freedom would be restricted, and so, but this is definitely not true. I also feel that Some men look at the woman as a only housewife, and by spending money on her as if he is giving her a compassion, it is also one of the most important reasons makes the women think to become with independent income.",

          "In my opinion, a woman whether she is married with children or not, is entitled to work because she, like the man, has studied and worked hard. Therefore, she should not sacrifice staying at home to raise children or work at home, Knowing that a worker woman may have a negative effect on children, but she is not forced, especially at the present time, everything has changed, and it is better for the woman to be independent. Work is very important for women, morally and not just financially more important than this is the husband’s support for her, as the basis of the marital relationship is participation in everything, including raising children, for example.",

          "I believe this matter is that’s of mutual agreement, so no one has the right to have a unilateral opinion. The couple can handle it together, and the daughter can handle it with her father I mentioned the father because, most of the time, it’s the father who opposes, not the mother. This mainly happens in our Arab countries due to our customs and traditions, so it requires mutual agreement. If I’m going to discuss this matter with my future wife, I’ll tell her that I don’t mind if she wants to work, but with conditions. She must be able to manage the home, meaning one shouldn’t overwhelm the other. The house should not affect her work, and her work should not affect the house. However, I acknowledge that things might be different if we have children in the future.",

          "I think that modern education methods have proven their efficiency and many advantages have been noted, such as: They make the student more creative, because it enhances hisher abilities and skills of thinking, observation, and inference. They enable the student to know the problem and find a solution to it and It makes explain ideas easier than the traditional methods.",

          "Since I studied in both periods or in both ways, I suffered a lot during school days, there was no Internet available for learning. Going to get, for example, a broader explanation of the subject from a center was expensive and exhausting. The greatest reliance was on the teachers, and here is the problem because if there is a student, for example, who did not understand the teacher’s explanation, he fails in the subject simply because any other source was almost impossible, while these days and currently as a student and as a teacher, I am strongly in favor of modern methods of education because they are diverse and suit different levels of students from the weak academically to the distinguished one.",

          "I think that this is a really controversial topic. For me, I see that traditional or modern methods both have advantages that are indispensable at the present time, and they also both have some harmful disadvantages. I see that one of the most important advantages of traditional methods is that they make you interact with your teacher or lecturer in an effective manner and make you highly committed. With what you do, modern means provide you with many sources that strengthen your information in your field. But I see a serious flaw in modern means, which is that while you are studying on the phone, it increases the ways of distraction for you through social media and so on. Finally, I see that traditional methods are better for me.",

          "I think that depends on the country's prosperity itself, maybe old generation struggled in getting proper education and lack of civilization like water, electricity and internet, but in general their life was easier and simple, in addition that they can raise a family without high costs and working less hours with great wages because of the good economy, Current generation in our country are really struggling in a lot of prospects of life, they literally live harsh life. For instance, they cannot get married easily because it costs a massive amount of money and they should work long hours with incredibly low cost so they can live under the low limit of good life, so ultimately country's prosperity plays a vital role in the way of people's life whether harsh or comfortable.",

          "Of course, both generations face challenges, and it's difficult to say definitively that one has it more luxurious than the other because it depends on many factors, such as whether you live in a developing country, which is undoubtedly more challenging than living in a developed country. It also depends on parents' financial situation and their ability to provide a good education. These conditions can play a role in both generations. But in my opinion, the current generation is suffering more. One of its disadvantages is the pervasive influence of technology and social media. For example, if we compare the current generation with the older generation regarding reading habits, we see a significant difference. Statistics indicate that most of the current generation suffers from overthinking and to a lesser extent ADHD (for children), due to excessive phone and technology use, which can damage mental health. However, the older generation also faced significant challenges, such as wars and a lack of technology. While the absence of technology had its drawbacks, it also had some benefits.",
